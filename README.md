## **Motivation**

After a 1-year pandemic, we all need a vacation...

## **Research Questions**
- When is the best time of year to book a hotel room?
- What is the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate?
- Do customers prefer to stay at a City Hotel or Resort Hotel? 
- How many nights on average do guests with children stay vs. guests w/o children

## **Objectives**
- Predict minimum, maximum, average, etc. hotel occupancy in relation to customer preferences.
- Predict seasonality by hotel type and market segment.
- Predict the number of nights stayed for types of guests.

## **Data Sources**
- [Hotel Booking Demand](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand)


## **Action Items**
- Data cleaning and shaping
  - Data comes from/affiliated with an article Hotel Booking Demand Datasets 
  - Data was cleaned by Thomas Mock and Antoine Bichat
  - Is there further noise/info we want to weed out?
- ML Model
  - Which model to use (try multiple models)
  - Ensemble?/Classifier/Decision Tree/Regression
    - Pick 3-5?
  - Which parameters/inputs produce the best outcomes (train/test split; different inputs for each ML model type aka reference documentation; which models are most efficient)
  - Look at data in different ways? Is the model/data better for predicting in the summer/winter/fall/etc? Should we try forecasting for specific date ranges, like spring break, holiday breaks, etc.
  - Were our models better at city hotel (business travel based?) vs. resort hotel (vacation travel based?)
- Data Visualization 
  - Visualize by city hotel & resort hotel
  - Visualize by season
  - Visualize different demographics
  - Visualize different ML model outcomes?
