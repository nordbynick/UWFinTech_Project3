# The Hotel Dilemma

## **Team Members**
- Monique
- Tony 
- April 
- Nick 

## **Motivation**

After a 1-year pandemic, we all need a vacation...

## **Research Questions**
- Using data and machine learning models, can hotel cancellations be predicted?
- If yes to the above question, what models and methods most accurately predict hotel cancellations?

## **Objectives**
- Build a ML model that can predict whether a reservation will be canceled. 
- Analyze and understand data via organization, visualization, and dashboards

## **Data Sources**
- [Hotel Booking Demand](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand)

## **Action Items**
- Data cleaning and shaping
  - Data comes from/affiliated with an article Hotel Booking Demand Datasets 
  - Data was cleaned by Thomas Mock and Antoine Bichat (additional cleaning and organization conducted by April & Nick)
  - Is there further noise/info we want to weed out?
- ML Model
  - Which model to use (try multiple models)
  - Ensemble/Classifier/Decision Tree/Regression? Pick several and also apply resampling techniques if needed. We predict classifier models will be the most effective given we will be 
  - Which parameters/inputs produce the best outcomes (train/test split; different inputs for each ML model type aka reference documentation; which models are most efficient, what features in the dataset can we eliminate)
  - Look at data in different ways? Is the model/data better for predicting in the summer/winter/fall/etc? Should we try forecasting for specific date ranges, like spring break, holiday breaks, etc. This will be a reach if we have time.
  - Were our models better at city hotel (business travel based?) vs. resort hotel (vacation travel based?). This will also be a reach if we have time.
- Data Visualization 
  - Visualize by city hotel & resort hotel
  - Visualize by season
  - Visualize different demographics
  - Visualize different ML model outcomes?

## **Technologies**
- Jupyter lab
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Sklearn
- Pyviz
- More to be imported and utilized in our python files

## **Atachments**
- Analysis Folder - Please find our ML python files
- Visualization Folder - Please find our visualization python files

## **Outcomes**
- Using machine learning models, our Team was able to predict hotel cancellations with confidence (particularly using the SMOTEENN Resampling + BalancedRandomForestClassifier model). Please see our uploaded slide show for an in depth analysis of the outcomes.
